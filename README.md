# cra-template-milkiyd


## The base template for React apps built by Milkiyd.


<br/>

This template aims to be a good starting point for a new React app, skipping the most common steps after setting up the project with create-react-app base template.

<br/>

It inludes the following:
- a fully working and responsive navbar
- a folder structure which boosts the development process
- react-icons for the project
- react-router-dom to create multipages websites

<br/>

***
## Installation
`npx create-react-app my-awesome-app --template milkiyd`

where ***my-awesome-app*** is the name of your project.
